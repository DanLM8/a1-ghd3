I created a basic stick figure drawing, with added reactivity. Each part of the figure is a separate shape, line, or path. 

Technical and Design Achievements: 
    - Created an animation of the figure waving hello when the user hovers over the arm. 
    - Created a color gradient to put the character in short sleeves
    - Added a path for the character's smile
    - Learned how to place text within an SVG to add instructions
